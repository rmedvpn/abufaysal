                    Hello, we are the Machteret!

                <div style="overflow: auto; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
                    Our organization was founded at 2014 by a group of friends in order to create a safe, simple and affordable platform for Cannabis purchase in Israel.

                <div style="overflow: auto; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
                    At the time, buying medical grade Cannabis at a reasonable price was nearly impossible, 
                    and the hudreds of thousands of Cannabis users thoroughout the country were forced to deal with criminals
                    in order to get their weed. to pay extremly high prices, or simply to stay without it for long periods of time.

                <div style="overflow: auto; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
                    Back in the day, even the Cannabis products that could be obtained were of very poor quality, and in general,
                    the weed loving community was in a very bad place.
                    
                </div>
                <div style="overflow: auto; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
                    On that ground, the founding members of our organization has decided to start our first growing facility, which was very unstratigically 
                    located in a semi ruined apartment building in southern Tel-Aviv.

                </div>
                <div style="overflow: auto; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
                    It wasn't to long before the rumor of the high quality of our products took off, and as the demand grew, we grew with it.
                    
                    over the years we have expanded our growing facilities, created solid partnerships with other growers and distributers, and 
                    our system began to take form.
